# Reddit Marketing

MUST guide Reddit marketing with 100% rule compliance, authentic engagement, zero spam violations.

## Overview

Execute Reddit marketing strategy ensuring community guidelines adherence, engagement authenticity, growth tactics implementation. Reddit enforces strict anti-spam rules (90/10 contribution ratio), FTC disclosure laws (fall 2024 ruling), karma thresholds, shadowban triggers. Platform reached 444M weekly users (Q3 2025), 21% YoY growth. Success requires 3-6 months consistent authentic engagement before promotional content.

## Core Principles

### 90/10 Rule (CRITICAL)
- MUST maintain 90% value contribution, MAXIMUM 10% promotion
- Track ratio: 9 value comments/posts per 1 promotional mention
- Value = answering questions, sharing expertise, community participation
- Promotion = product mentions, company links, CTAs

### Account Warmup Requirements
- MINIMUM 60 days authentic participation before brand content
- Build karma through pure value contributions
- NEVER new account → immediate promotion (90% ban rate within 30 days)
- Target: 10-100+ karma before promotional activity (subreddit-dependent)

### Authenticity Over Marketing
- Redditors detect corporate speak with surgical precision
- Traditional marketing tactics backfire spectacularly
- Community-first mindset required (not brand-first)
- Long-term relationship building (2-4 weeks minimum before promotion reduces campaign costs 60-80%)

## Phase 1: Research & Verification

**CRITICAL:** MUST verify ALL subreddit rules before posting. Platform-wide rules insufficient.

### Subreddit Research Protocol

1. **Read sidebar rules** (NEVER assume)
   - Self-promotion policy (many ban outright)
   - Karma threshold (common: 10-100 points)
   - Account age minimum (common: 7-30 days)
   - Posting frequency limits (typically 1/day per subreddit)

2. **Check wiki/FAQ** for additional restrictions

3. **Analyze successful posts**
   - Tone/style that resonates
   - Timing patterns (use RedditMetis/subredditstats.com)
   - Content types (text vs link vs image)

4. **Identify moderator stance**
   - Pro-business vs anti-marketing sentiment
   - ModMail responsiveness
   - Enforcement strictness

5. **Use checklist:** `references/subreddit-rules-verification.md`

### Red Flags (NEVER Post)
- ❌ "No self-promotion" in rules
- ❌ Karma threshold > current karma
- ❌ Account age requirement > account age
- ❌ Recent ModMail indicates anti-brand sentiment

## Phase 2: Account Building (60-90 Days)

**Timeline:** Days 1-60 = pure value, Days 61-90 = light introduction, Days 91+ = strategic promotion

### Karma Building Strategy

**Days 1-30: Lurk + Learn**
- Read top posts in target subreddits
- Study comment patterns
- Identify community pain points
- ZERO self-promotion

**Days 31-60: Value Contribution**
- Answer questions (detailed, actionable)
- Share expertise (no product mentions)
- Upvote helpful content
- Build comment karma: 50-100+ points
- Use templates: `assets/engagement-templates.md` (value-first section ONLY)

**Days 61-90: Gradual Introduction**
- Continue value contribution (still 90%)
- Light mentions of experience (10%)
- Example: "In my work doing X, I've found Y approach works best..."
- NEVER direct product links yet

**Days 91+: Strategic Promotion**
- Maintain 90/10 ratio rigorously
- Use light promotion templates: `assets/engagement-templates.md`
- Track upvote ratio (>70% = effective, <50% = too promotional)

### Posting Timing Optimization

**Best Times (EST):**
- 6-9 AM (before work check)
- 12-2 PM (lunch hour peak, professionals)
- 7-9 PM (evening unwind)

**Best Days:**
- ✅ Tuesday-Thursday (highest engagement)
- ❌ Monday, Friday (activity drops)
- ❌ Weekends (consistently underperform)

**Frequency Limits:**
- MAXIMUM 1 submission per subreddit per day
- Wait 5-15 minutes between posts
- NEVER rapid-fire posting (spam detection trigger)

## Phase 3: Content Execution

### Content Types by Stage

**Stage 1: Pure Value (Days 1-60)**
- Detailed answers to questions
- "Here's what I've learned..." posts
- Troubleshooting help
- Industry insights (no brand mention)

**Stage 2: Experience Sharing (Days 61-90)**
- "When I worked on X..." stories
- Behind-the-scenes insights
- Lessons learned (include failures)
- Expertise demonstrations

**Stage 3: Strategic Promotion (Days 91+)**
- Case studies (honest, including drawbacks)
- "Full disclosure: I work for X, but..." transparency
- Competitor comparisons (objective)
- Resource sharing (add disclaimer)

### Engagement Templates

**Use:** `assets/engagement-templates.md`

**Ratio Enforcement:**
- 9 value templates per 1 promotion template
- Customize NEVER copy-paste exact (triggers detection)
- Match subreddit tone (formal vs casual)

**Template Categories:**
- Value-first comments (answering, sharing expertise)
- Light promotion (when directly asked, case studies)
- Authentic storytelling (founder journey, behind-scenes)
- Crisis response (acknowledging complaints)

## Phase 4: AMA Strategy

AMAs (Ask Me Anything) = high-impact engagement format. Requires 1-2 weeks preparation.

### AMA Preparation

**Use:** `assets/ama-preparation-checklist.md`

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Moderator approval FIRST** (1-2 weeks advance via ModMail)
   - NEVER cold-post AMA (often deleted immediately)
2. **Title format:** "I am [who] [credentials], AMA!"
3. **First hour CRITICAL** (answer EVERY question, determines overall performance)
4. **Timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 12-2 PM or 6-8 PM EST
5. **Duration:** MINIMUM 1 hour, ideally 2-3 hours

### During AMA (Hour 0-1)

**MUST:**
- Answer EVERY question first 60 minutes (even brief responses)
- Use usernames when responding (increases engagement 30%)
- Mix detailed + quick answers (show you're reading all)
- NO off-topic restrictions (it's Ask Me ANYTHING)

**NEVER:**
- Long gaps without responses (kills engagement)
- Obvious sales pitches (instant downvotes)
- Ignore difficult questions (community notices)
- Delete unfavorable questions (massive backlash)

### Success Metrics
- 500+ upvotes = good
- 1000+ upvotes = great
- 5000+ upvotes = viral
- 50+ questions answered = strong engagement

## Phase 5: Compliance & Legal

### FTC Disclosure Requirements (2024)

**Use:** `references/ftc-compliance.md`

**Fall 2024 FTC Ruling:** Banned fake reviews, upvote buying, fake grassroots campaigns

**MUST Disclose If:**
- Payment received (cash, products, services)
- Free or discounted products
- Employment relationship
- Affiliate commission

**Disclosure Format:**
- ✅ First 3 lines of post/comment
- ✅ Plain language: #Ad, #Sponsored, #Paid
- ✅ Post title: "[Sponsored]" or "[Ad]" prefix
- ❌ Buried in hashtag group (non-compliant)
- ❌ Vague #Ambassador or #Partner

**Penalties:** $51,744 per violation (each undisclosed post = separate violation)

### Reddit-Specific Violations

**NEVER:**
- Buy upvotes (FTC + Reddit violation)
- Pay unaffiliated accounts to mention brand
- Orchestrate fake grassroots campaigns
- Use bots for engagement
- Vote manipulation/brigading

## Phase 6: Crisis Management

**Use:** `references/crisis-response-protocol.md`

Reddit crises escalate faster than traditional social media (upvote amplification). 24-48 hour response window CRITICAL.

### Crisis Detection Triggers

Immediate response if:
- Negative post reaches 500+ upvotes in 6 hours
- Brand mention in r/all with negative sentiment
- Moderator contact about rule violation
- Sentiment shift detected (Brand24, Meltwater, Sprout Social)

### Response Timeline

**Hour 0-2:** Assessment (identify source, gather facts, DO NOT respond yet)
**Hour 2-6:** Strategy (formulate response, get legal approval if needed)
**Hour 6-24:** Public response (acknowledge, empathize, accountability, action plan)
**Hour 24-48:** Follow-through (deliver on promises, update thread)

### Response Format (MUST Include)

1. Acknowledgment ("We see this, we're listening")
2. Empathy ("We understand why this is frustrating")
3. Accountability (if at fault: "We made a mistake")
4. Action plan ("Here's what we're doing to fix it")
5. Timeline ("We'll update within X hours")
6. Contact option ("DM us for individual assistance")

### Reddit-Specific Tone

- ✅ Human, conversational
- ✅ Admit fault directly (no corporate speak)
- ✅ Specific action steps
- ❌ NEVER defensive or dismissive
- ❌ NEVER delete negative comments (amplifies crisis)
- ❌ NEVER obvious PR statements

## Measurement & Analytics

### Essential KPIs

**Engagement Metrics:**
- Karma (upvotes - downvotes)
- Upvote ratio (>70% = effective, <50% = too promotional)
- Comment depth (multi-turn = authentic engagement)
- Response rate (track community replies)

**Traffic Metrics:**
- Click-through rate (CTR) from Reddit to site
- Conversion attribution (60-90 day journey typical)
- Cost per click (CPC) for paid campaigns

**Community Health:**
- Sentiment analysis (Brand24, Meltwater, Sprout Social)
- Brand mentions (daily monitoring)
- Subreddit growth (if brand subreddit exists)

### Monitoring Tools (2025)

**Recommended:**
- Brand24 (Reddit-specific sentiment analysis)
- Meltwater (cross-platform monitoring + LLM tracking)
- Sprout Social (real-time alerts)
- RedditMetis (subreddit analytics)
- Postpone/Later for Reddit (scheduling tools)

**Alert Setup:**
- Daily brand mention scans
- Sentiment trend tracking (catch negative shifts early)
- Google Alerts: "reddit [brand] [negative keywords]"
- Subreddit-specific monitoring

## Paid vs Organic Strategy

### Organic (Recommended Primary)

**Timeline:** 3-6 months for results
**Budget:** Time investment (community manager)
**ROI:** Trust equity, market intelligence, long-term relationships

**When Organic Works Best:**
- Building brand authority
- Community-driven products
- Long-term customer relationships
- Market research needs

### Paid Advertising

**Formats:**
- Promoted Posts (blend into feeds, "Promoted" label)
- Takeover Ads (premium, front page)

**Budget:** MINIMUM $5/day, typical $500-2000/month for success

**When Paid Works Best:**
- Immediate traffic needs
- Product launches
- Event promotion
- Amplifying organic content

**Recommended Approach:** 40% paid + 60% organic (Fortune 100 companies approach)

## Anti-Patterns (Guaranteed Failure)

### ❌ NEVER Do These

**Account Management:**
- New account → immediate promotion (90% ban rate)
- Use company name as username (signals marketer)
- VPN/datacenter proxies (flagged; use residential/mobile ONLY)
- Same link >5-8x per day (spam filter)
- Multiple accounts for vote manipulation

**Content Mistakes:**
- Identical content across subreddits (copy-paste detection)
- Generic sales pitches
- SEO keyword stuffing
- Fake "organic" mentions
- Corporate non-answers

**Engagement Failures:**
- Ignore difficult questions
- Long response gaps
- Delete negative comments
- Defensive/dismissive tone
- Skip account warmup period

### ✅ Success Patterns

- Follow 90/10 rule religiously
- Build karma 60+ days before promotion
- Verify subreddit rules EVERY time
- Use authentic, conversational tone
- Respond to criticism transparently
- Disclose material connections clearly
- Monitor sentiment daily
- Answer AMA questions comprehensively
- Track upvote ratios (adjust if <70%)
