# Subreddit Rules Verification Checklist

MUST verify ALL items before posting to ANY subreddit.

## Pre-Posting Verification

- [ ] Read sidebar rules (NEVER assume platform-wide rules apply)
- [ ] Check wiki/FAQ for additional restrictions
- [ ] Verify karma threshold requirements (common: 10-100 points)
- [ ] Check account age minimum (common: 7-30 days)
- [ ] Identify self-promotion policy (many ban outright or require weekly threads)
- [ ] Note posting frequency limits (typically 1 per day per subreddit)
- [ ] Check approved domains list (some subreddits whitelist only)
- [ ] Verify if moderator approval required for brand accounts

## Content Restrictions

- [ ] Link posts allowed? (some text-only)
- [ ] Video/image posts permitted?
- [ ] Cross-posting enabled?
- [ ] Flair requirement? (often mandatory)
- [ ] Title format rules? (character limits, required keywords)
- [ ] Comment minimum for link posts?

## Timing & Frequency

- [ ] Peak activity hours for this subreddit (use RedditMetis/subredditstats.com)
- [ ] Restricted posting days? (some limit weekends)
- [ ] Minimum time between posts (enforced by AutoMod)

## Red Flags (NEVER post if present)

- ❌ "No self-promotion" in rules
- ❌ "Promotional content banned"
- ❌ "Marketers will be banned"
- ❌ Recent ModMail indicates anti-brand sentiment
- ❌ Karma threshold > your current karma
- ❌ Account age requirement > your account age

## Recovery Actions

If banned:
1. Read ban message for specific violation
2. Review subreddit rules again
3. If unintentional violation: polite ModMail apology + explanation
4. If intentional violation: accept ban, document for future avoidance
5. NEVER create alt account to evade ban (triggers site-wide suspension)
