# Crisis Response Protocol for Reddit

Reddit crises escalate faster than traditional social media (upvote amplification). 24-48 hour response window critical.

## Crisis Detection Triggers

IMMEDIATE response if:
- Negative post reaches 500+ upvotes in 6 hours
- Brand mention in r/all with negative sentiment
- Moderator contact about rule violation
- Multiple subreddits discussing same issue
- Sentiment shift detected by monitoring tools (Brand24, Meltwater)

## Response Timeline

### Hour 0-2 (Assessment)

- [ ] Identify crisis source (specific post/comment/subreddit)
- [ ] Determine if legitimate complaint or misunderstanding
- [ ] Check if rule violation occurred
- [ ] Assess severity (isolated vs widespread)
- [ ] Alert crisis management team
- [ ] DO NOT respond publicly yet (gather facts first)

### Hour 2-6 (Strategy)

- [ ] Formulate response approach (acknowledge/apologize/correct/compensate)
- [ ] Draft response (authentic, non-corporate tone required)
- [ ] Get legal approval if needed
- [ ] Identify response account (brand account vs employee account)
- [ ] Prepare to monitor reply thread

### Hour 6-24 (Response)

Response format MUST include:
1. Acknowledgment ("We see this, we're listening")
2. Empathy ("We understand why this is frustrating")
3. Accountability (if at fault: "We made a mistake")
4. Action plan ("Here's what we're doing to fix it")
5. Timeline ("We'll update within X hours")
6. Contact option ("DM us for individual assistance")

Reddit-specific tone:
- ✅ Human, conversational
- ✅ Admit fault directly (no corporate speak)
- ✅ Specific action steps (not vague promises)
- ❌ NEVER defensive or dismissive
- ❌ NEVER delete negative comments (amplifies crisis)
- ❌ NEVER obvious PR statements

### Hour 24-48 (Follow-Through)

- [ ] Deliver on promised actions
- [ ] Update original response thread
- [ ] Monitor for additional flare-ups
- [ ] Track sentiment shift (negative → neutral → positive)
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Example Responses

Title: [BrandX Response] We messed up with the recent update

Hey everyone, BrandX employee here. We see the frustration about
the pricing change and you're absolutely right - we didn't
communicate this well.

Here's what happened: [honest explanation]

Here's what we're doing:
1. Reverting the change for existing users (live by Friday)
2. Publishing pricing changes 30 days in advance going forward
3. Adding community feedback channel before major decisions

I'll update this thread Friday when reversion is complete.
For individual account issues, DM me directly.

Sorry we let you down. We're listening.

## Crisis Prevention

Proactive monitoring:
- Daily Brand24/Meltwater scans for brand mentions
- Track sentiment trends (catch negative shift early)
- Monitor r/CompanyName subreddit (if exists)
- Set Google Alerts for "reddit [brand] [negative keywords]"
- Weekly review of top posts in relevant subreddits

## Escalation Matrix

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Responder |
|----------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Low | <100 upvotes, isolated complaint | 24 hours | Community manager |
| Medium | 100-500 upvotes, multiple mentions | 6 hours | Marketing lead |
| High | 500-2000 upvotes, trending in subreddit | 2 hours | VP Marketing + Legal |
| Critical | >2000 upvotes, r/all, media pickup | 1 hour | C-suite + PR firm |

## Post-Crisis Recovery

After resolution:
1. Thank community for feedback
2. Document changes implemented
3. Share learnings transparently ("Here's how we'll prevent this")
4. Monitor for 30 days (crises can reignite)
5. Build positive content to dilute negative search results
