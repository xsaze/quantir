# FTC Compliance Guidelines for Reddit Marketing

Fall 2024 FTC ruling bans fake reviews, upvote buying, fake grassroots campaigns. MUST comply.

## Material Connections Requiring Disclosure

MUST disclose if ANY of these apply:
- Payment received (cash, products, services)
- Free or discounted products/services
- Employment relationship
- Familial relationship
- Affiliate commission
- Partnership or sponsorship

## Disclosure Requirements (2024 Standards)

### Clear and Conspicuous

- ✅ First 3 lines of post/comment (NEVER buried in hashtag group)
- ✅ Plain language: #Ad, #Sponsored, #Paid (NEVER vague #Ambassador)
- ✅ Every platform/post (NEVER assume carryover from previous disclosures)
- ✅ Close to claim (NEVER separated from endorsement)

### Approved Hashtags

| Safe | Vague (Avoid) |
|------|---------------|
| #Ad | #Thanks |
| #Sponsored | #Ambassador |
| #Paid | #Partner |
| #BrandName_Ad | #Collab |
| #BrandName_Partner | #Gifted (unclear if paid) |

### Placement Rules

Reddit-specific:
- Post title: Include "[Sponsored]" or "[Ad]" prefix
- Comment: First sentence must disclose
- AMA: Title AND first response must state relationship
- Flair: Use if subreddit has "Sponsored" flair option

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

- $51,744 per violation (each undisclosed post = separate violation)
- FTC enforcement actions (public record, brand damage)
- Reddit community backlash (downvotes, ban, reputation loss)
- Legal action from competitors

## Examples

### ✅ Compliant

```
Title: [Sponsored] How I improved productivity with ToolX
Body: Disclosure: I work for ToolX and this is a sponsored post.
[rest of content]
```

```
Comment: Full disclosure - I'm a paid affiliate for ServiceY.
That said, here's my honest experience...
```

### ❌ Non-Compliant

```
Title: How I improved productivity
Body: [content]
...
...
[buried in text] Thanks to BrandX for the opportunity #collab
```

```
Comment: Love this product! [no disclosure, but poster received free product]
```

## Monitoring Compliance

- Audit ALL brand-related content quarterly
- Train influencers/partners on disclosure requirements
- Monitor for compliance (NEVER assume they'll self-comply)
- Document disclosure training (defensible position if violation occurs)

## Red Flags

NEVER:
- Buy upvotes (explicit FTC violation fall 2024)
- Pay unaffiliated accounts to mention brand
- Orchestrate fake grassroots campaigns
- Use bots for engagement
- Manipulate voting (Reddit + FTC violation)
