# AMA (Ask Me Anything) Preparation Checklist

Successful AMAs require 1-2 weeks preparation. First hour determines overall performance.

## Pre-AMA Preparation (1-2 Weeks Before)

### Step 1: Moderator Contact
- [ ] Identify target subreddit (aligned with expertise)
- [ ] Contact moderators via ModMail (MINIMUM 1-2 weeks advance)
- [ ] Provide: who you are, expertise, proposed date/time, proof of identity
- [ ] Get moderator approval (NEVER cold-post AMA - often deleted immediately)
- [ ] Confirm posting date/time with moderators

### Step 2: Proof Preparation
- [ ] Create proof document (photo with username + date OR official website link)
- [ ] Host proof image (Imgur, company site)
- [ ] Prepare verification statement for moderators

### Step 3: Title Crafting
Format: "I am [who] [credentials/why interesting], AMA!"

Examples:
- ✅ "I'm a Reddit data scientist who analyzed 10B comments, AMA!"
- ✅ "I'm the founder of [Company] that helps X, AMA about building Y!"
- ❌ "AMA about marketing" (too vague, no credentials)

Required elements:
- [ ] Brief identity (who you are)
- [ ] Credentials or interesting fact (why you matter)
- [ ] "AMA" or "Ask me anything" phrase (required for visibility)

### Step 4: Bio Writing
- [ ] 3-5 paragraph bio expanding on title
- [ ] Explain expertise in detail
- [ ] Include "why" doing AMA (value to community, not promotion)
- [ ] Add proof link
- [ ] Include relevant links (MAXIMUM 1-2, not spammy)

### Step 5: Promotion Planning
- [ ] Draft promotional tweets (pre-AMA + live)
- [ ] Email list announcement (if applicable)
- [ ] LinkedIn post (if professional topic)
- [ ] Schedule reminders

## Optimal Timing

### Best Days
- ✅ Tuesday-Thursday (highest engagement)
- ❌ Monday, Friday (activity drops)
- ❌ Weekends (consistently underperform)

### Best Times (EST)
- 12-2 PM EST (lunch hour peak, professionals on Reddit)
- 6-8 PM EST (evening peak, broader audience)
- AVOID early morning (<9 AM) or late night (>10 PM)

### Duration
- [ ] Block MINIMUM 1 hour calendar time
- [ ] Ideally 2-3 hours for high engagement
- [ ] First 60 minutes CRITICAL (answer EVERY question, even briefly)

## During AMA (Hour 0-1 CRITICAL)

### First Hour Protocol
- [ ] Answer EVERY question in first 60 minutes
- [ ] Use usernames when responding (increases engagement 30%)
- [ ] Vary question types (not just softballs - show authenticity)
- [ ] Short responses OK if acknowledging ("Great question! [brief answer]")
- [ ] NO off-topic questions (it's Ask Me ANYTHING)

### Response Quality
Mix of:
- [ ] Detailed answers (expertise showcase)
- [ ] Quick acknowledgments (show you're reading all)
- [ ] Humorous responses (appropriate to context)
- [ ] Personal anecdotes (humanize brand)

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Long gaps without responses (kills engagement)
- ❌ Obvious sales pitches (instant downvotes)
- ❌ Ignoring difficult questions (community notices)
- ❌ Corporate/PR speak (be human)
- ❌ Deleting unfavorable questions (massive backlash)

## Post-AMA (Hour 2+)

### Ongoing Engagement
- [ ] Continue answering questions for 24-48 hours (diminishing returns after)
- [ ] Upvote good questions (shows appreciation)
- [ ] Follow up on complex questions requiring research
- [ ] Update original post if major themes emerge

### Promotion During
- [ ] Tweet live link when AMA goes live
- [ ] Post to other social channels
- [ ] Email list update with link
- [ ] Pin tweet for duration

## Measurement

### Success Metrics
- Upvotes on AMA post (500+ = good, 1000+ = great, 5000+ = viral)
- Number of questions answered (50+ = good engagement)
- Comment depth (multi-turn conversations = authentic engagement)
- Traffic to website (if link included)
- Brand sentiment shift (monitor with Brand24/Meltwater)

### Red Flags (Indicates Poor AMA)
- ❌ Negative upvote ratio (<60% upvoted)
- ❌ Top comments are critical
- ❌ Response time >15 minutes first hour
- ❌ Promotional tone detected by community

## Example AMAs to Study

Successful:
- Bill Gates AMAs (thousands of questions, authentic responses)
- Economists AMA threads (expert depth)
- Product founder AMAs with transparency

Failed (learn what NOT to do):
- Woody Harrelson "Rampart" AMA (only promoted movie, ignored questions)
- AMAs with long response gaps
- Corporate PR AMAs with canned responses

## Template Response Starters

Authentic engagement phrases:
- "Great question! Here's what I've learned..."
- "This is something we struggled with early on..."
- "Honestly, we made mistakes here. What we learned was..."
- "I don't have a perfect answer, but my experience has been..."
- "You're absolutely right to question this. Here's the reality..."

AVOID corporate speak:
- ❌ "We're always working to improve our products and services"
- ❌ "Please contact our support team"
- ❌ "We appreciate your feedback"
