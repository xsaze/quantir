## Template Usage Guidelines

RULES:
- Use value templates 9x for every 1x promotion template
- Customize templates (NEVER copy-paste exactly)
- Include real details (replace brackets with specifics)
- Match subreddit tone (formal vs casual)
- NEVER use same template across multiple subreddits (copy-paste detection)

METRICS:
- Upvote ratio >70% = effective template
- Upvote ratio <50% = too promotional, dial back
- No replies = not engaging enough, add question or controversial take
- Downvotes + critical replies = violated community norms, study mistake
