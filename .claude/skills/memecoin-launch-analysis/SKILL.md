**Reference:** `references/buyer-psychology.md`

**Primary Triggers:**

| Trigger | Statistics | Activation Method |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| FOMO | 84% crypto investors act on FOMO, 58% frequently | Showcase early gains, countdown timers, "X SOL until graduation" |
| Herd Mentality | Self-reinforcing price loops | Display growing holders, transaction volume, trending status |
| Community Belonging | Strong digital identity, shared purpose | Exclusive groups, shared memes, collective goals, recognition |
| Dopamine Mechanics | Gambling-like neurological response | Real-time charts, bonding curve visualization, holder rankings |
| Viral Success Stories | Fartcoin 2M% return narrative | Overnight fortunes, AI endorsements, $1B in <60 days |

**Cognitive Biases:**
